# üå≤ Forrest Rock, Paper, Scissors üçÑ

## Description
You will play your computer opponent in a game of rock, paper, scissors. There are two levels: classic and difficult. The classic game, using rock, paper, and scisssors. Or, if you are feeling spicy, you may choose the difficult level. The difficult level includes rock, paper, scisors, mushroom, and bigfoot. 

## Game Play

You will begin by choosing to play either a classic or difficult game. Next, you will choose your fighter. Once your fighter is chosen, the game will begin automatically and the results of the game will be displayed. If a player wins, an announcment will pop up to annouce their win. The winners' win count will increase, and a new game will automatically begin. Should the game result in a draw, neither score will increase.

* [bigfoot](https://freerangeamerican.us/lesser-known-bigfoot-legends/)

## Challenges
* Refactoring my code so that the separation of data model logic and DOM logic is clear and that all of my DOM manipulation is handled exclusively in main.js.

## Wins
* CSS - I am proud of my slyling for this site as compared to past projects. 
* I learned new tools for debugging code and feel that my understanding of class to class interaction has finally come full circle.
